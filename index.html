            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3><strong>I'm a novice web developer studying to establish a career in the IT industry</strong></h3>

                <p>I have a Bsc and an MSc in a maths and physics subject relating to micro to macro-scale oceanographic systems.<br>
                During that time I gained valuable experience solving problems and writing code. For instance, a notable project was tsunami waves hitting underwater banks <br>
                leading to the analyse of the mixing processes occurring during the event. The assorted projects I was involved in were written in either FORTRAN, MatLab or Python.<br>
                <br>
                Currently, I am training in front & back-end development to improve my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript through various courses and projects.<br>
                Across the projects, I have exposed myself to an assortment of java frameworks, in particular, Node.js and Express.js.<br>
                </p>

        <div>
        <h1>Portfolio</h1>

        <p>My portfolio consists of two elements, firstly, models written during my education which consists of coastal and <br> open ocean wave & tidal dynamics 
           along with meteorological models of pressure systems. <br>
           Secondly, projects written in JavaScript to refine my fundamental knowledge of web development <br> 
           and to help begin my pursuit into the IT industry.
